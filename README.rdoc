= Relativity

Time, Date and DateTime classes don't have a mode for working with relative
time inside 1 day (or 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter, etc.).

A relative time object, relative to a day or a week, is useful to describe
e.g. opening hours of a business. In a next phase, time ranges will
be built on top, so the ranges of opening hours can be represented.

== Example

  require 'relativity'
  opens_at = DayTime.new(9) #=> 09:00:00
  closes_at = DayTime.new(18,30) #=> 18:30:00

  dt = DayTime.new #=> 21:17:40
  dt.seconds_since_midnight #=> #<BigDecimal:9d35d48,'0.7666056825 7238E5',18(45)>
  dt.hours #=> 21
  dt.minutes #=> 17
  dt.seconds #=> 40
  dt.nano_seconds #=> 568257238
