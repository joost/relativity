Refactoring:

* Use DayTime, WeekTime, WeekDay, QuarterTime, ...
* use "seconds_since_start" (instead of "seconds_since_midnight)

Features to be implemented:

day_time = DayTime.new
week_time = WeekTime.new
week_day = WeekDay.new

day_times (array of day_time entries)

day_time_range (range of days_time entries)
week_time_range
week_day_range

ActiveRecord coupling (Aggregation ?)
